# codingCpp
This is a repository that aims to get you through first steps in coding C++. Most examples have been adjusted from a webpage created by Rob Miller, and now amended (till 2019) by William Knottenbelt (https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wjk/c++Intro/CourseStructure.html#S2)
# General Instructions: 
1. Create a new project and add files to this project as instructed below. When using Visual Studio as compiler, a header file may be created automatically (please keep this file)
2. Run the project, typically using the option (Visual Studio): Debug > Start Without Debugging menu (easiest).
# Examples in chronological order:
1. Hello world (modified): First code, that prints "Hadesmechanics says hello to the world". Later a secret message is printed using progressions (run the code and discover it!)
  Files that should be added to the newly created cpp project in the code are: hello_modified.cpp
